Hello! I'm kevidryon2; I develop things that run on Linux, and I (mostly) use C.

## WHAT Tech Stack
I made my own tech stack: the WHAT tech stack. It represents:

- Weaver (not yet released publicly), a PHP script for generating blog pages from a document with a special syntax (kinda like Markdown, except using completely different symbols).
- Halifax (not yer released publicly), a Linux database daemon, which can store data in a key/value type of way; each table contains a list of key/value pairs, and the value can be another table.
- Alpine Linux, which I picked really just because of the name).
- [Tiger](https://github.com/kevidryon2/Tiger), a web server, and a new generation of my earlier project, [Rabbit](https://github.com/kevidryon2/rabbit), which I renamed to Tiger to avoid confusion with RabbitMQ.
